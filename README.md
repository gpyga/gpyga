I am primarily interested in marrying ML with traditional OR/MS methods. Adjacently, I am interested in research methods in general. Being self-taught, I am always looking for more learning resources, [please share](https://github.com/gpyga/gpyga/discussions)!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [OpenORMS/vyvodi](https://github.com/OpenORMS/vyvodi) - mixed effect neural network layers (name is a placeholder). After I get a better grasp of how I want this to be implemented, I will look for more collaboration. I am currently looking at using [bambinos/formulae](https://github.com/bambinos/formulae) as an interface.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [OpenORMS](https://github.com/OpenORMS). The goal here is to develop open-source, more direct solutions to common management problems. I have a backlog in my head, but I haven't oriented quite yet. If you have any ideas, please feel free to take part in [the discussion](https://github.com/OpenORMS/OpenORMS/discussions). I also want to celebrate the solutions which others have developed, so feel free to share anything you've done/found!
- ðŸŒ± I currently learning about hardware acceleration with JAX and I am always learning more about probabilistic methods.
